The people 
Write it down 
By the water 
Who will make it? 
You and I 
What will they do? 
He called me. 
We had their dog. 
What did they say? 
When would you go? 
No way 
A number of people 
One or two 
How long are they? 
More than the other 
Come and get it. 
How many words? 
Part of the time 
This is a good day. 
Can you see? 
Sit down. 
Now and then 
But not me 
Go find her 
Not now 
Look for some people. 
I like him. 
So there you are. 
Out of the water 
A long time 
We were here 
Have you seen it? 
Could you go? 
One more time 
We like to write. 
All day long 
Into the water 
It’s about time 
The other people 
Up in the air 
She said to go 
Which way? 
Each of us 
He has it. 
What are these? 
If we were older 
There was an old man 
It’s no use 
It may fall down. 
With his mom 
At your house 
From my room 
It’s been a long time. 
Will you be good? 
Give them to me. 
Then we will go. 
Now is the time 
An angry cat 
May I go first? 
Write your name. 
This is my cat. 
That dog is big. 
Get on the bus. 
Two of us 
Did you see it? 
The first word 
See the water 
As big as the first 
But not for me 
When will we go? 
How did they get it? 
From here to there 
Number two 
More people 
Look up 
Go down 
All or some 
Did you like it? 
A long way to go 
When did they go? 
For some of your people
